# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis & Safety Dashboard
## 📌 Project Summary

This project presents an end-to-end data analytics solution to understand why, when, and where road accidents occur, to support data-driven road safety decisions by government authorities.

Using real-world accident data, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and BI dashboard development to identify accident hotspots, high-risk time periods, and factors contributing to accident severity.

##🎯 Business Objective

Help policymakers and traffic authorities:

Identify accident-prone locations

Understand peak accident times

Reduce fatalities and casualties

Prioritize infrastructure and enforcement efforts

## 🗂 Dataset Overview

Each row represents one road accident

Key attributes include:

Location (State, City, Area)

Time (Hour, Day, Month)

Accident severity

Weather and road conditions

Vehicles involved

Casualties and fatalities

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Power BI: Data modeling, DAX, interactive dashboards

Excel: Initial data validation

GitHub: Version control and documentation

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

Data cleaning and standardization (location, time, categories)

Handling missing and inconsistent values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time-based accident trend analysis

Location-based hotspot analysis

Severity and casualty impact analysis

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights
KPI Cards

Total Accidents

Fatal Accidents

Total Casualties

Fatality Rate (%)

Visual Insights

Accidents by reliability hour and day of week

Top accident-prone states and cities

Accident causes vs severity

Casualty patterns across vehicle types

Filters

Year

City

Weather Conditions


## 📈 Key Insights

A small number of states and cities contribute to the majority of accidents

Accident frequency peaks during rush hours and weekends

One accident often results in multiple casualties

Poor weather and high-speed zones significantly increase accident severity

## 🚧 Data-Driven Recommendations

Target high-risk locations with infrastructure upgrades

Increase traffic enforcement during peak accident hours

Improve lighting and signage in accident-prone areas

Strengthen drunk-driving prevention and speed control

Enhance accident data collection and reporting quality

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Predictive accident risk modeling

Integration with real-time traffic data

Deployment on Power BI Service for live monitoring
