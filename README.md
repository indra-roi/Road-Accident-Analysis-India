# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis & Safety Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data to identify when, where, and why accidents occur.
The goal is to provide data-driven insights and safety recommendations for government authorities.

---

## 🗂 Dataset
- Road accident data including location, time, severity, weather, road conditions, and casualties
- Each row represents one accident

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Google Collab
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Excel
- GitHub

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-based and location-based accident trends
- Severity and casualty analysis
- Identification of accident hotspots

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- KPI Cards:
  - Total Accidents
  - Fatal Accidents
  - Total Casualties
  - Fatality Rate
- Visualizations:
  - Accidents by hour and day
  - Top accident-prone states and cities
  - Accident causes vs severity
- Filters:
  - Year
  - City
  - Weather conditions

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- A small number of states and cities contribute to most accidents
- Accident frequency peaks during rush hours and weekends
- Poor weather and high-speed zones increase accident severity
- One accident often results in multiple casualties

---

## 🚧 Recommendations
- Target high-risk locations for infrastructure improvements
- Increase enforcement during peak accident hours
- Improve road lighting and weather-responsive warnings
- Strengthen drunk-driving prevention programs
